# Package Handler library
#
# Include this file before you invoke pkg_xxx functions.
#
# These are the routines that implement local package handling.
# Specifically, there is support for installing them.
#
# These routines detect the current operation system and/or
# packaging discipline, with a fallback on apt under Debian.
#
# All packages are named as on Debian Linux, at least for now,
# so translation may be necessary.
